I designed this program as part of a team during my fourth semester of college for Data Structures & Algorithms 2. The goal was to create a program that can find and visualize the shortest path between two nodes using various algorithms. Each node was to correspond to a room on a map of the National Gallery and the path drawn should be navigable by visitors. The algorithms used were Dijkstra's and DFS, both visualized using different colours on screen (blue and yellow, respectively) and their paths could be altered to avoid or prefer certain rooms.

I worked on this project with Alexander Berbenitskiy,
